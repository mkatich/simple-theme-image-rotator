# simple-theme-image-rotator
Rotate the banner image of your Wordpress site to show a different one each day, week, hour, etc., or even random on each page load. There are plenty of options for rotation period. Put your images in your /wp-content/stir-user-images/ directory and this plugin will recognize them, and load the current one depending on what day/time it is.

Installation:
1. Unzip into /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Create a directory in your /wp-content/ folder named "stir-user-images". This is where your images will be stored.
3. Activate the plugin from the admin panel.
4. Go to 'Settings' in the admin panel, and then 'Simple Theme Image Rotator' to configure and upload images.
5. Enjoy!
